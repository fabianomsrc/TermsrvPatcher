# How to use
Download TermsrvPatcher.ps1 file and place it in any folder e.g. 'C:\Users\YourUserName\Downloads'

Run PowerShell as Administrator

Go to the folder your script is in

> PowerShell Cmdlet

```powershell
Set-Location -Path C:\Users\Fabiano\Downloads
```

> CMD

```cmd
cd c:\Users\YourUserName\Downloads
```

Before running the script, need to change PowerShell script execution policy

```powershell

powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -NoProfile -NonInteractive -File C:\Users\YourUserName\Downloads\TermsrvPatcher.ps1
```
